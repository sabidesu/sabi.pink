so i decided to get a new url because i didn't particularly care for `sabidesu.dev`. honestly, i'm not sure what i was thinking a year ago... but oh well! i decided why not `sabi.pink` because, y'know, my fursona *is* pink after all. it was honestly between this and `sabi.rip`, but a friend said that makes me sound like i'm dead which like, i think would've been hilarious tbh. *anyways*, new url! yippee!

also! i have basic [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) integration working with this site, because obsidian's become my favorite note-taking and writing app. so now i can write blog posts all from obsidian from pretty much any device, which i think is pretty cool to be honest! my one gripe is that on my primary machine (a windows gaming laptop), i use WSL to develop this site. however, you can't open WSL directories in obsidian! bummer! so i had to set up my git install on windows and that was a pain in the ass and bleh. but it works now! if anyone's curious how to do it, you can use [this](https://dev.to/joeholmes/creating-a-diy-digital-garden-with-obsidian-and-gatsby-378e) lovely guide by Joe Holmes, but i didn't follow the whole thing, since i feel like i got it working well enough, so if anything's out of date, i wouldn't know ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. you'll also notice how these posts aren't super styled because uh... *i can't be bothered rn tbh.* but perhaps another time!
